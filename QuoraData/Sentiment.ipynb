Apple come to India for the recruitment, and they first hired from IIITH. I think you also aware of the fact that IIITH CSE Syllabus is some how better than IITs CSE Syllabus. You don't have to study Science Subjects, mechanics, Engineering Drawing in IIITH. You have to study CSE Subjects from 1st year onwards. Also IIITH’s Coding Culture is famous. Their coding assignment is way more different and difficult than any other engineering colleges in India. Every year they Consistently produce ACM ICPC World Finalists. The select\", 'This information is entirely wrong as Apple is visiting other IITs also, currently they visited IIT Bombay, IIT Guwahati and next would be IIT Kanpur or IIT Delhi. Also the CTC (Cost to Company) offered by them is same in all the colleges (I can not disclose the amount). I think news agencies should avoid spreading such false facts. Apple may have chosen to visit IIITH first because someone in their Talent Acquisition Team might be an alum of the college. There are many factors behind something and we as a responsible and educated citizens must not judge the college based entirely on it’s placement stats.', 'Student life at IIIT Hyderabad is excellent!!

Starting from the freshman year, we have a Computer programming course in the first semester, and data structures in the second semester. Both of them are programming heavy courses, where students receive regular assignments, and are required to submit that on an internal online judge (which is pretty much exactly similar to SPOJ / CodeChef / CodeForces in format). Mostly your grades depend on how well you do in these assignments. This gets students started in competitive progra\", 'Applicants in this mode need to appear for a computer-based, undergraduate entrance examination (UGEE) both conducted by IIIT-H.This exam has two sections: Subject Proficiency Test (SUPR) and Research Aptitude Test (REAP) Candidates shortlisted from this exam will have to clear an interview to gain admission. The decision on final offer of admission is solely based on the interview performance. You need to register online and fill an application form to appear for the exam by the announced deadline. a) SUPR -- Subject Proficiency test for 60 minutes. b) REAP -- Research Aptitude Test for 120 minutes. The syllabi for SUPR and REAP are based on XI and XII level of Physics/Maths/Chemistry (CBSE and most state syllabi).

By mentioning academically I mean assignments, course structure, syllabus etc. But life opportunities/exposure at BITS Pilani > IIITH. Also CSE is something which you can learn best by following less on books/syllabus and more on self study/practice/being up to date in technologies. If you want a great placement or would like to build yourself into a tech entrepreneur you can do it in both places but you can do it BITS Pilani by having more fun, exposure and FREEDOM. On a final note IIITH CSE is for a guy who would have to choose between the NITs not BITS Pilani/IITB/IITD/IITKGP/IITM/IITK. I know its in the air that IIITH is good. But I think it has become popular because it is not expected that IIITH CSE/IIITH CSE gr', 'With good understanding and strategy, it is pretty easy to get IIIT Hyderabad.

But i still think that may be in the round 4 or 5 you can get IIITH but you will have to wait a lot for that. People usually don’t go that far because it involves a risk factor. And if you don’t get upgraded to CSE then you will have to satisfy either with ECE in IIITH (in case you book it in the previous rounds by paying some money) or nothing at all. But there are many other colleges which you can get in this rank. Colleges such as NSIT and', 'Don’t you find difference in ECE and IT as you are asking the question as a comparison between two colleges as well as two different branches. If you ask as NITK IT or CSE and IITH IT or CSE . I would say go for IIITH. This institute is only famous for CSE and IT branches only. As well as the average package that is offered to IITH IT is around 18LPA instead of 11–12 LPA in NITK IT. In IITH, you will get the best environment of CSE and IT than all the NITs and IIITs. But if you are really interested to have an answer to this question, then come to NITK IT instead of going for ECE IITH. ECE at NITK is also the best among all NITs as well as IT is, that’s another thing of having IT in very few colleges. So have a priority to select NITK IT instead of IITH ECE you will find the difference once y', 'No, it is nothing like that. Anyone can prepare for UGEE IIITH examination. With full dedication and motive anyone can clear the examination.Can take help of *IIT prep* materials for better studies and results :)', \"Hi, The interview is mostly simple but also depends on your presence of mind.Also I guess they take the college into consideration too. For me as soon as I entered the room they asked about the field I was interested in? I thought they were asking about the respective fields (humanities or linguistics) so I answered accordingly. But I could have just told them a subject and they would have asked questions from there. So that's one thing to remember. You could prepare a subject very well. Rest is all up to your preparation for the interview and a little bit of presence of mind and you are good to go. All the best!! :)\", 'Its academics and research are awesome, and placements are also fine. But, if you are getting IIITH, then you must also be getting IITG, I would suggest going for it. In the long run, IITG would be better and placements wise too. PS: Never take IITR.', 'Ohh man ! Finally someone has asked this question here. I’m a postgrad from IIIT H VLSI. Sad part is now they have discontinued Masters in VLSI due to lack of professors. Soon they might restart it again. Placements wise it was good the year i was attending placement season. Overall is considerably good. Companies like : Sandisk, Xylinx, Samsung, IBM, Synopsis, Mentor Graphics, Qualcomm, Nvidia, MicroSemi, Texas Instruments etcc visit the campus every year. So dont worry about the placements. Good student always fetches something or the other, Never left alone.', \"It's good! But you should really be research oriented.

But I would suggest you to go for IIITH-CS cuz IIIT were setup for these type of courses and IIIT-H'CS is well known all over the world\", \"It was pretty decent.Actually I dont know what could happen but in my views they asked me nothing . When the online interview started at first they asked me my name. I told them my name is --------. Then they asked me about my hobbies and interest and why i am intrested in research ? Why I want to join IIIT Hyderabad? All at once I answered them that my hobby is watching youtube videos, I am interested in volunteering and working with Ngo's and I am also interested in opening up electronic items and trying to repair it.Then why research? - I answered them that I want to become a scientist and research allows me to think out of the box and -------xyzabc---------.

I was very happy about it, but also a bit sad at the same time because Ii felt that I would not be shortlisted. He checked my results on his phone and … Well Done!! You have been shortlisted for the interview at IIIT Hyderabad. I was very happy on hearing this, but as you know friends (how CRUEL they are :P), so I just confirmed it by asking him to send a screenshot of it. Only then I was satisfied ^-^ Now, Hoping for the best at the interview. All the best to everyone who has cleared it ^_^ Edit : I got 85.5 marks in UGEE. Just got the cut-off by 0.5 marks.', 'No. There are many other companies which have a much higher pay than what Apple offered when they visited IIIT Hyderabad. People will rely more on average placement stats of a college as compared to selection of handful students in a particular company. Not sure about iPhone fans out there :P', 'What’s there in a name? \"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet,\" wrote William Shakespeare in the play Romeo. When you have so many IITs, they would naturally not be able to have the same brand value of IIT. The name of IIT is not going to guarantee quality education. Some IITs would continue to be world class while others would not be even as good as NITs and many Private Engineering Colleges. The most important function for an institute is to provide quality education. This quality comes from three broad factors. 1. The quality of teachers 2. The quality of students 3. The quality of infrastructures The IITs can perhaps have the world class infrastructure as government gives lavish funds to set up an IIT. However, it may be extremely different to get good faculty since all IITs pay the same sal', 'It is out already.', 'The Interview went very nicely , The Panel was very supportive and the questions they were asking were known by me so I answerd them very confidently. I was so confident on my answers because of IIIT prep as their website IIITprep .com helped me a lot in studies and their PDFs had covered all the necessary topics. You can also download their App IIIT PREP it will guide you with last year papers , UGEE paper analysis etc. Their books IIIT PREP PUBLICATION are one of the best for the study of IIIT Hyderabad.', 'People are in general not aware about lateral entry possibility at IIITH. Therefore the competitions is very less as compared to other modes. For example, for 30–40 seats combined in ECE and CSE, we may get 300–400 applicants, but we are able to hardly able to fill half the seats.', 'To be completely honest, we have no idea how the test is going to be since this is the first time there is only one test for all dual degrees. But the syllabus consists of 11th and 12th grade PCM. So I think it will be something on the pattern of Mains. Have a look at the sample papers too.', \"A2A From both research and placements perspective, clearly IIITH >> MNNIT. Though MNNIT is, in general, a good and reputed institute. For academics, I'm not aware of the systems and resources at MNNIT, so I shouldn't make a comparison. When it comes to industry and academia, IIITH is big brand and its quickly becoming more and more reputed. However, for common people, IIT is still the brand. If you tell some random layman that you are at IIITH, they would likely either - (i) Not recognize the name and think you are in some random institute. or (ii) compare it to Indian Institutes of IT and think you couldn't make it to any NIT or new IIT hence ended up here. Also, you won't get much increase in no. of followers for putting IIITH in your Quora profile, but might go in thousands if it is one le\", 'Mast scene hai bhai.

Com helps you with PDFs , previous years papers , PAPER PATTERNS etc.', 'IIITH has a very good CS course which is on par or maybe better than the ones at old IITs. However the campus social life & extracurricular activities are limited compared to other universities. BITS Pilani is more about all round development of the student with good acads and a plethora of extracurricular activities. IMO you should talk to seniors studying CS at these universities. It will help you to take a final decision.', \"In your UGEE interview, you will be asked about application of the principles you learned. You will be tested whether you can apply basic topics in daily life. They ask practical questions, like a way to optimise some method, whether that optimisation is feasibly and affordable or not. Also, is there some cheap work around to a method, which uses less resources but gives same result. You will be asked about your preferred topics in the interview. However, you still need to be prepared with the complete JEE syllabus. For example, if you say your favorite topic is gravitation and you explain the solar system to them, they'll ask, what will happen if we replace the planets with charged objects. How will it affect the solar system. For this, you require knowledge of gravitation and electromagne\", \"Firstly, whatever I write in this answer is solely my opinion and view. It in no way represents an answer by IIIT-H community or anything of sort. Also, apologies for not so well written answer. Secondly, there are a lot of factors for someone to choose IIIT-H over IIT. Following could be some of many: 1) They didnt get a good rank in IIT-JEE entrance exam, and in turn would prefer to be a CS graduate rather than just doing BTech in any branch. 2) They are really interested in CS and want to take it up as their undergraduate degree, but their JEE rank wasnt good enough to land them into one in any of the top IIT's. The reason I say top IIT's is explained later in the answer. 3) Not such a big factor but sometimes people have location preference or are well aware about CS curriculum here and\", \"Ok, hold your horses right there. Now that you have made it to IIIT (hearty congratulations since you did), you have a almost a month to yourself. Of course, if you think you want to have an upper hand at programming and you know you have zero experience right now, so if you feel you want to look up something, look up C Programming Basics on the Net. (I know everybody's saying it but still, your choice bro) Once you're in college, this is what you must do. First thing you need is an undeterred focus on lectures. Many people fall asleep during lectures, maybe because the prof. sounds mundane or the course but mostly because of lack of sleep. Second thing you need is continuing to follow-up. Third thing is to keep on practising programming. You will get to know everything eventually. Also, keep\", 'Yeah , there is a possibility of getting CSE in IIIT-H with 259 score in JEE main score. Incase you are not getting in the middle rounds wait till the last round .Generally the cutoff for CSE ends at 260 or 258 every year. But with 259 score you will definitely get ECE in IIIT-H. Often cutoff for ECE will go near 220. CSE at IIIT-H is dream for many aspirants .I suggest you to opt CSE if you are getting it. ALL THE BEST ! CHEERS !!']\n"
